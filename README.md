Prometheus Server
========

A monitoring solution for Docker hosts and containers with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor),
[NodeExporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) and alerting with [AlertManager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager).



## Install

Clone this repository on your Docker host, cd into dockprom directory and run compose up:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sofiafernandezmoreno/prometheus_server


ADMIN_USER=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin docker-compose up -d
```

Prerequisites:

* Docker Engine >= 1.13
* Docker Compose >= 1.11

Containers:

* Prometheus (metrics database) `http://<host-ip>:9090`
* Prometheus-Pushgateway (push acceptor for ephemeral and batch jobs) `http://<host-ip>:9091`
* AlertManager (alerts management) `http://<host-ip>:9093`

* NodeExporter (host metrics collector)
* cAdvisor (containers metrics collector)
* Nginx (proxy and basic auth provider for prometheus and alertmanager)

## Define alerts

Three alert groups have been setup within the [alert.rules](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules) configuration file:

* Monitoring services alerts [targets](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules#L2-L11)
* Docker Host alerts [host](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules#L13-L40)
* Docker Containers alerts [containers](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules#L42-L69)

You can modify the alert rules and reload them by making a HTTP POST call to Prometheus:

```
curl -X POST http://admin:admin@<host-ip>:9090/-/reload
```

***Monitoring services alerts***

Trigger an alert if any of the monitoring targets (node-exporter and cAdvisor) are down for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: monitor_service_down
    expr: up == 0
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Monitor service non-operational"
      description: "Service {{ $labels.instance }} is down."
```

***Docker Host alerts***

Trigger an alert if the Docker host CPU is under high load for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: high_cpu_load
    expr: node_load1 > 1.5
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Server under high load"
      description: "Docker host is under high load, the avg load 1m is at {{ $value}}. Reported by instance {{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }}."
```

Modify the load threshold based on your CPU cores.

Trigger an alert if the Docker host memory is almost full:

```yaml
- alert: high_memory_load
    expr: (sum(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) - sum(node_memory_MemFree_bytes + node_memory_Buffers_bytes + node_memory_Cached_bytes) ) / sum(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) * 100 > 85
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Server memory is almost full"
      description: "Docker host memory usage is {{ humanize $value}}%. Reported by instance {{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }}."
```

Trigger an alert if the Docker host storage is almost full:

```yaml
- alert: high_storage_load
    expr: (node_filesystem_size_bytes{fstype="aufs"} - node_filesystem_free_bytes{fstype="aufs"}) / node_filesystem_size_bytes{fstype="aufs"}  * 100 > 85
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Server storage is almost full"
      description: "Docker host storage usage is {{ humanize $value}}%. Reported by instance {{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }}."
```


## Setup alerting

The AlertManager service is responsible for handling alerts sent by Prometheus server.
AlertManager can send notifications via email, Pushover, Slack, HipChat or any other system that exposes a webhook interface.
A complete list of integrations can be found [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration).

You can view and silence notifications by accessing `http://<host-ip>:9093`.

The notification receivers can be configured in [alertmanager/config.yml](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/alertmanager/config.yml) file.

To receive alerts via Slack you need to make a custom integration by choose ***incoming web hooks*** in your Slack team app page.
You can find more details on setting up Slack integration [here](http://www.robustperception.io/using-slack-with-the-alertmanager/).

Copy the Slack Webhook URL into the ***api_url*** field and specify a Slack ***channel***.

```yaml
route:
    receiver: 'slack'

receivers:
    - name: 'slack'
      slack_configs:
          - send_resolved: true
            text: "{{ .CommonAnnotations.description }}"
            username: 'Prometheus'
            channel: '#<channel>'
            api_url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/<webhook-id>'
```

## Sending metrics to the Pushgateway

The [pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) is used to collect data from batch jobs or from services.

To push data, simply execute:

    echo "some_metric 3.14" | curl --data-binary @- http://user:password@localhost:9091/metrics/job/some_job

Please replace the `user:password` part with your user and password set in the initial configuration (default: `admin:admin`).
